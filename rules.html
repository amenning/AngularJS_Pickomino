				<h2>Goal: Collect the most worms!</h2>
				<h2>Step 1.  Roll the dice.</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>If this is your first roll this turn, go to Step 2.</li>

					<li>If the result does not include anything you have not already collected, your turn ends immediately.  You must take the top tile from your stack (if any) and place it back on the grill.  If you return a worm, then flip over the highest valued tile on the grill, unless it is the tile just returned.  The flipped over tile is out of the game.  <!--The next player should start his turn at Step 1.--></li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				
				<h2>Step 2.  Select one number/symbol from the resulting dice roll and collect all matching dice, adding them to your collection.</h2>
				
				<ul>
					<li>If a worm is not among your collected dice, go to Step 1.</li>

					<li>If the sum of your collected dice (worms are worth five) is less than the value of every face-up tile on the grill, and is not equal to any of the tiles on top of other players' stacks, go to Step 1.</li>
				
					<br/>
					<li>Otherwise make a choice:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Go to Step 1</li>
						<p>OR</p>
						<li>Take any worm of equal or less value than your frozen dice sum from the grill <!--either from the top of a player’s stack or from the table.  To take from a player, your sum must equal the value of the player’s tile.  To take from the table, you can take the matching value or any available value lower than your sum.  The taken tile is placed on top of your stack and your turn ends.--></li>
					</ul>
					<!--li>If there are more face-up tiles on the table, the next player should start his turn at Step 1.  If there are no more face-up tiles on the table, the game is over, and the winner is the player with the highest number of worms on his tiles (the tie-breaker is the highest value tile).</li-->
